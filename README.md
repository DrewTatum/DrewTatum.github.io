Hello, my name is Drew Tatum. I was born in Alabama but spent middle school and high school in Costa Rica, where I 
learned to speak Spanish. I am currently a graduate student at DePaul University obtaining my Master's in Data Science. 
I began my Data Science journey as an undergraduate student studying Exercise Science who fell in love with statistics 
and machine learning. After graduating from my Exercise Science program in three years, I spent the next two years of 
my undergraduate degree obtaining a minor in Statistics and another minor in Computing. Currently, I am looking for a 
summer 2022 internship to finish my Data Science Master's program.

## Projects
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DrewTatum/MarchMania2022">2022 March Madness Monte Carlo Bracket Simulation (In Progress)</a>
<ul>
<li>Created multiple Monte Carlo based algorithms to simulate and predict the final results of the 2022 March Madness bracket</li>
<li>Applied different statistical approaches like Bayesian and Markov Chain </li>
<li>Relied on randomness by determining the distribution and likelihood of each parameter in the model based on historical data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DrewTatum/InformationRetrievalSystem">DePaul Course Catalog Intelligent Information Retrieval System (In Progress)</a>
<ul>
<li>Returned the most similar courses offered at DePaul University to the user based on their query after weighting the terms and computing their similarity </li>
<li>Created web crawler to index the courses from DePaul Universityâ€™s course catalog </li>
<li>Used a weighting similarity scheme based on the course title versus the course description</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://drewtatum.github.io/NBA_Position/">NBA Player Position Clustering Analysis</a>
<ul>
<li>Explored the relationship between a player's position based on game stats, physique, and draft position </li>
<li>Viewed player positions in two ways: The first as 5 separate positions (PG, SG, SF, PF, C) and the second as three groups (Guards, Forwards, Centers) </li>
<li>Applied different PCA kernels to the player clusters to try and distinguish the positions in a lower dimensional space </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content Based Car Recommender System
<ul>
<li>Created two different systems to recommend a car to a user based on 7 different input parameters (year, cost, number of doors, etc...)</li>
<li>Developed a k-means clustering algorithm where similarity scores were calculated using their Euclidean norm </li>
<li>Implemented a PCA version (reduced number of features from 50 to 8) to recommend the user a car to compare to the initial model </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Baseball Hall of Fame Classification Algorithm
<ul>
<li>Designed multiple machine learning classification techniques to classify players as HOF inductees</li>
<li>Used a KNN algorithm with hyperparameter tuning to account for the unbalanced classification labels</li>
<li>Performed a cluster analysis to see which features hall of fame players had in common</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

# About Me

Hello, my name is Drew Tatum. I am a graduate student at DePaul University obtaining 
my Master's in Data Science. I began my Data Science journey as an undergraduate student
studying Exercise Science who fell in love with statistics and machine learning. After 
graduating from my Exercise Science program in three years I spent the next two years 
of my undergraduate degree obtaining a minor in Statistics and another minor in 
Computing. I am passionate about research within the medical and sport fields. 

## Projects
<ul>
<li>March Madness Monte Carlo Bracket Simulation (In Progress)
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DePaul Course Catalog Intelligent Information Retrieval System (In Progress)
<ul>
<li>This system is a course information retrieval system that returns the most similar courses offered at DePaul University to the user based on their query.</li>
<li>A web crawler was created to index the courses and other functions were created to compute the similarity scores and modify the user query</li>
<li>Additionally this system offers a recommender system approach by offering courses that are similar to other courses the student has enjoyed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="NEEDLINK">Content Based Car Recommender System</a>
<ul>
<li>This project used two different approaches to offer a car to a user based on 7 different parameters (Car year, car cost, number of doors, etc...)</li>
<li>The first approach used a k-means clustering algorithm where similarity scores were calculated</li>
<li>The second approach used a PCA version (reduced number of features from 50 to 8) to recommend the user a car</li>
</ul>
